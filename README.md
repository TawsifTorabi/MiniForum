# MiniForum

A Lite and Simple PHP Script to make a Online Q&A Forum for Student Groups
  

## Notes
I'm working on a newer version. Hoping to release this on this october on this repo.</br>
But an rough zip of the PHP Codes is uploaded to the <a href="https://github.com/TawsifTorabi/MiniForum/tree/development">**development** Branch</a>. You can try the rough one.

The New MiniForum features like a Group Communication System. Like Facebook Group. </br>
I did not use any php framework, Just Used Raw PHP programming to make this one.

# Features
## User Interface Feature
1. Unfortunately only made for desktop platform. I did the whole project on my own, so making it responsive is a big work to do.
2. Unlike the last version, I added CSS and Ajax to make the UI more dynamic to the user.
3. The User Interface almost feels like facebook group communication system. But not!

## User Features
1. Creating A Forum on the MiniForum Platform.
2. Discovering new forums for all users.
3. A Forum can be made private to revoke access to public.
4. A User can create maximum 50 forums.
5. Forum Owner can add moderators.
6. Owner and Moderators can moderate posts, comments.
7. Owner and Moderators can approve or delete members.

N.B: The Older Quirk version is moved to the <a href="https://github.com/TawsifTorabi/MiniForum/tree/Old-PHP">Old-PHP Branch</a>
