A Lite and Simple PHP Script to make a Online Q&A Forum for Student Groups

  

## Notes
I'm working on a newer version. Hoping to release this on this october on this repo.</br>
But an rough zip of the PHP Codes is uploaded to the development branch. You can try the rough one.

N.B: The Older Quirk version is moved to the <a href="https://github.com/TawsifTorabi/MiniForum/tree/Old-PHP">Old-PHP Branch</a>
